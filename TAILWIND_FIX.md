# Tailwind CSS Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Updated `@source` directives in `resources/css/app.css`**
   - **Problem**: The `@source` paths were pointing to incorrect locations
   - **Solution**: Updated to proper relative paths:
     ```css
     @source "../views/**/*.blade.php";
     @source "../js/**/*.js";
     @source "../../vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Pagination/resources/views/*.blade.php";
     ```

### 2. **Built assets for production**
   - Ran `npm run build` to compile Tailwind CSS
   - Generated optimized CSS in `public/build/assets/`

### 3. **Started development server**
   - Running `npm run dev` on http://localhost:5173
   - Vite will now watch for changes and hot-reload

## How to Use

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Keep this running while developing. Tailwind will automatically compile as you make changes.

### For Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Run this before deploying to generate optimized assets.

## Your Setup (Tailwind v4)

You're using **Tailwind CSS v4** with the new `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin:
- ✅ No `tailwind.config.js` needed
- ✅ Configuration via `@source` directives in CSS
- ✅ Integrated with Laravel Vite plugin
- ✅ Custom CSS variables defined in `:root`

## Verify It's Working

1. Make sure `npm run dev` is running
2. Visit your Laravel app (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
3. Tailwind classes should now be styled correctly
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Common Issues

- **Styles not updating**: Restart `npm run dev`
- **Classes not working**: Check `@source` paths in `resources/css/app.css`
- **Build errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
